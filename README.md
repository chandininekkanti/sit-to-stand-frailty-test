# Sit-to-Stand Frailty Test (Computer Vision)

This project uses computer vision and MediaPipe Pose to measure frailty based on sit-to-stand transitions using a webcam.

## ðŸ§ª Features

- Detects seated and standing posture
- Counts sit-to-stand repetitions
- Measures transition duration for frailty assessment
- Real-time feedback using OpenCV

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV (cv2)
- MediaPipe Pose (BlazePose)
- NumPy

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python numpy
